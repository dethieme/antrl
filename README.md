# PizzaOrdering grammar

A small project for creating a PizzaOrdering grammar with ANTLR.
The grammar definition can be found in [./antlr/PizzaOrdering.g4](src/main/antlr/PizzaOrdering.g4)

This is the second part of the DSL exercise.
For part one see [github.com/dethieme/dsl](https://github.com/dethieme/dsl).
