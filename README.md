# PizzaOrdering grammar

A small project for creating a PizzaOrdering grammar with ANTLR.
The grammar definition can be found in [./antlr/PizzaOrdering.g4](src/main/antlr/PizzaOrdering.g4)

The build.gradle was created based on Gabriele Tomasseti's great [The ANTL Mega Tutorial](https://tomassetti.me/antlr-mega-tutorial/)

This is the second part of the DSL exercise.
For part one see [github.com/dethieme/dsl](https://github.com/dethieme/dsl).
